GUIDING QUESTIONS FOR STEP BY STEP ANALYSIS: 

## Ask

What is the problem you are trying to solve?
I will try to produce a report with the following deliverables:
A clear statement of the business task.
A description of all data sources used.
Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data.
A summary of your analysis.
Supporting visualizations and key findings.
Top three recommendations based on my analysis.

To answer the question "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?" I will calculate the number of trips per membership type, the average length of trip per membership type on a daily basis, the type of bike, start and end stations, and day time preferred by membership type as well as seasonal trends.

How can your insights drive business decisions?
A data anaylist's insights are well-researched and based on data-analysis.
The insights influence business decisions to a great extent since they lead to recommendations that might regard marketing efforts, the service or concept itself, and allocation of budget. 

## Prepare

Where is your data located?
The .cvs data is located in zip files in an index made available by Motivate International Inc. 

How is the data organized?
The data is organized yearly and quarterly. I will be using only the first quarter of 2020. 

Are there issues with bias or credibility in this data? Does your data ROCCC?
ROCCC which stands for Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, and Cited.
The data was made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license (https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

Reliable --- Yes, since there is a high number of respondents.
Original --- Yes, it is provided by the company itself. It is first-party data.
Comprehensive --- Yes, it includes duration, start and end stations, and most of the information needed to answer the business question for insightful conclusions.
Current --- Yes, the data is current and updated on a monthly schedule. However, I will be using a summary of the first quarter of 2020 since it is the last recollection of data in a bigger quantity. 
Cited --- The company collects the data itself, but I am unsure of the process, hence unknown.

How are you addressing licensing, privacy, security, and accessibility?
The license has already been cited.
The data was anonymized and therefore private.
The data is stored in the hard drive of my computer.
The data is open-source, so it is available for free downloading.

How did you verify the data's integrity?
I checked the website and the license.

How does it help you answer your question?
The data gives me information about the different types of riders and their preferences.

Are there any problems with the data?
There is a lot of information and the files are separate by month, which doesn't allow for a thorough case study.
Therefore I will be using data that is not current (first quarter of 2020) for this case study.


## Process

What tools are you choosing and why?
I will be using R for the analysis of this data as well as for simple visualizations. R also allows for a Markdown Notebook to facilitate documenting the process. 
I will document the cleaning process using R markdown and storing it in GitHub.


## Analyse

How should you organize your data to perform analysis on it?
I will organize it in tables and temporary subsets and tibbles to easily have an overview of data and draw conclusions. 

Has your data been properly formatted?
I made sure that the 'started_at' and 'ended_at' columns were properly formatted into 'ymd_hms' using 'lubridate'. 

What surprises did you discover in the data?
I was surprised by some of the conclusions, for example, that casual riders use the bike for longer periods of time. 

What trends or relationships did you find in the data?
Some trends were that casual members used the service for leisure activities (from or to stations that were near parks or tourist attractions) while annual members used it for commuting (presumably work or study related activities). 

How will these insights help answer your business questions?
These insights allow me to draw conclusions backed by facts on, for example, where to place advertisements or who the target audience is. 

## Share 
Were you able to answer the question of how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? 
Yes, I found information regarding their differences and similarities. 
What story does your data tell? 
It tells me that casual riders (even if they use the service for a longer period of time) are not firstly interested in an annual membership, even if they use the bike for over three months. This might be because the annual membership is too long. If there were monthly membership, the casual riders could turn into long-term customers. 
Casual riders might also only be visiting the city and therefore might not need a longer membership.  
Another conclusion drawn is that annual members use the service for commuting to and from work during weekdays while casual members for leisure activities on the weekend. 
How do your findings relate to your original question? 
My findings are relevant because they discover trends and preferences of the different membership types. 
Who is your audience? What is the best way to communicate with them? 
My audience are stakeholders. I should only deliver the recommendations backed by the conclusions and including relevant visualizations.
Can data visualization help you share your findings? 
Yes, it would make it easier to interpret results. 
Is your presentation accessible to your audience?
I will use color schemes that are appropriate and label the information. I will also add a short paragraph explaining the viz. I will not use technical language.

## Act 
What is your final conclusion based on your analysis? 
Casual riders use the service sporadically only for leisure and entertainment purposes while annual members use the service for commuting. 
In order to get a higher engagement from casual riders, the service should include perks based on their preferences. 
How could your team and business apply your insights? 
The insights lead to business recommendations for the service itself and for marketing purposes. 
What next steps would you or your stakeholders take based on your findings? 
Trial version of the suggestions or market study on the suggested perks. 
Is there additional data you could use to expand on your findings?
Market study for the suggested perks and personal information about the users.
